# Kill the AI Game
This game was inspired by the game "Death by AI" I discovered on discord. I decided to reverse the roll; I made the players be the one to kill the AI!

# Use it
Just open the index.html in a web browser or goto the website Kill The AI (https://killtheai.netlify.app). Hope you have fun with your friends!
To play have 1 person (the host) put in their Google Gemini API key (don't worry I won't share it) and it will create a 6 character code. Have your friends join (no player limit rn) via the code. Then the host clicks "START". Each round (5 total) 1 person gets to pick the scenario. Then everyone (including the guy who made the scenario) gets to write a response describing how they'll kill the AI. Then when everyone is done it will then type out the AI's story of the scenario and the player's response. It will tell you if the player survived or not. it will do this for all players and at the end it will show the current scores of everyone. The process (from choosing the scenario) will repeat until all rounds are completed. The everyone is sent back to the pregame lobby (where the host presses "START") to get ready to start another game!

# Want to contribute?
Some things I want to add are Transitions, SFX/Music, Make the UI better, Limit keywords in responses like "i win", more game modes where only 1 person can kill the AI, some different AI models, and just some overall polishing.
